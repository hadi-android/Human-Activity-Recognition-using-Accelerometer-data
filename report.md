# Machine-Learning-Assignment
I first removed columns from the training and testing sets that were NA or "". I then removed the first 7 columns since they are not relevant to the prediction of activity.
I used the random forest approach and performed 10-fold cross validation on the training set using 53 featuers.
I used the predict function to predict the class on the testing set.
